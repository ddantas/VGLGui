Morphological image processing, now a standard part of the imaging scientist's toolbox, can be applied to a wide range of industrial applications. Concentrating on applications, this book shows how to analyze a problem and then develop successful algorithms based on the analysis. The book is hands-on in a very real sense: readers can download a demonstration toolbox of techniques and images from the web so they can process the images according to examples in the text.
